Text me personally (not group) with a Y or N to each rule change proposal. All rule changes below were provided at the end of last season and seconded by another member. ALL proposals MUST be voted upon by each member.
Democracy - rule changes go into effect by 2/3rds vote.

The proposal to add a 60+ yd FG option where you get +6 for a successful attempt and =2 for a miss is nixed despite being seconded since Yahoo doesn't allow a 60 yd option. If we want to try and track this manually w/ physical point maniuplations taking place after the game, discuss in the group thread.

Proposal 1: Add one (1) Injured Reserve (IR) spot.
Proposal 2: Trophy will be a WWF style belt instead of something traditional. This year will bring us enough in keeper fees to FINALLY have a trophy at the end of the season.
Proposal 3: The prior years league winner has to pay the shipping fees to send the trophy to the new winner as pushishment for losing it. Otherwise, this fee will come out of the keeper funds which will reduce the end-of-season lottery.
Proposal 4: The pick-em pool is for actual NFL games and not fantasy football league matchups.
Proposal 5: The prior years consolidation winner picks the team name for whoever came in dead last. The team name remains for the whole year and cannot be changed. This is to entice competition throughout the whole season no matter your record.
Proposal 6: A flat rate keeper fee instead of $5 for 1st year keeper and $10 for 2nd year keeper. If passed, the fee will be discussed in the group chat.
Proposal 7: Entry fee increase from $125 to $150. If passed, a new payout structure will be posted.
