You can only keep a player for a maximum for 2 years in a row from the initial draft spot - meaning if you didn't keep a player for a 2nd year but ended up drafting him again this new year, your 2 years of keeper eligibiity restarts.

You can only keep a player whose on your team at the end of last year.
If you drafted a player the prior year, held him until the end of season, and want to keep him this year, you'll lose the pick for the round he was drafted in. 
If you want to keep a player on your team that was drafted initially by someone else, you'll lose the pick for the round he was drafted in by the initial owner.
If you want to keep a player who was not initially drafted the prior year, you'll lose a 10th round pick.

Keeping a player will cost you $5 if this is the first time you're keeping him. The keeper fee funds the league trophy and once purchased, will turn into a winner-take-all lottery for those who made the playoffs.
If you choose to keep the same player for a 2nd year in a row, it'll cost you $10 and you'll lose the next best round. Therefore you CAN keep a 1st round player for year one but can't keep him for year 2 since you can't lose a higher round pick.
